# Color system documentation

⚠️The color system is currently an unstable API, and is subject to change in non-major releases of Polaris react. Please use with caution.

## Surface (default: `#FAFAFA`)

The surface role is used for the backgrounds of our UIs, and consists of a range of gray hues. In light mode, surface colors are nearly white, while in dark mode, surface colors are nearly black. The color passed to the surface role impacts the rest of the color roles and their variants, adjusting them for light or dark contexts.

**Note** surface variants needed: inverse background, inverse foreground, dark background, dark foreground, light background, light foreground.

### Surface concepts

- **surface**: a variable background color that is light in light mode and dark in dark mode
- **inverse**: a variable background color that is dark in light mode and light in dark mode
- **dark**: a constant background color that is always dark regardless of mode
- **light**: a constant background color that is always light regardless of mode

### Surface Base: `--p-surface`

While use directly in our components is discouraged, the base variant is unmodified from the original role input color.

### Surface Background

### Surface Foreground Subdued
